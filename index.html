	                Congratulations! You are this site's 1000th visitor! Click <a href="https://joshclouse.com">here</a> to claim your prize! For those of you not brave enough to click that link, it just links back here. Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a game designer and software engineer. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Science: Game Design. Currently I work at Leia Inc where I create interactive applications to showcase the capabilites of our 3D displays. I love taking on problems and enjoy the energy that comes with collaborating with other engineers. An added bonus is when I get to work with peers across disciplines. Although I am most at home with Unity, I openly welcome opportunities that allow me to work outside my comfort zone. Wherever there are development needs, I'm always up for the challenge. 
	                <br><br>
	                In my free time I enjoy writing and playing music. I'm currently in a band. I'd provide a link to our page, but I think we need a bit more practice before I have that kind of confidence. If you are in need of a Unity Dev, Software Developer, or would just like to be serenaded feel free to contact me at <span class = "highlight">JoshMClouse@gmail.com</span>. My Linkedin and Github are also provided <a href = "#top-bar">above</a>.

	    			Worked on the automotive team to create interactive 3D applications in Unity to showcase the capabilites of our 3D displays. Planned, designed, and executed a complete re-design of the auto demo to increase sustainability and maintainability for future builds and development. Created general use scripts to unify color settings, sizing, and scaling to allow our application to easily port to all our devices. Worked closely with UI designers to implement their designs into our application.

		    			A VR game combined with a couch co-op experience, Wacktory is a fast paced game that forces players to work together in order to fill all their orders on time. With a diverse team of 13 memebers coming from varying backgrounds and roles, I took the lead on developing and implementing the core gameplay loop in addition to contributing pivotal game design decisions which greatly improved user experience. In addition to the gameplay loop, I was also responsible for implementing the UI in the main menu. On top of my duties as a core developer, I also composed the music for this game.

		    			Phonote is an app created in Android Studio by me and 4 other collaborators. It aims to help students take notes easier by converting images to text and autogenerating citation info. Users can either take a picture in the app, or use a picture from their gallery to convert into text. A book title is all that is needed to automatically generate citation info. Users can also save their projects to google drive. Development on the project has stopped and the app is not available on Google Play, however a video showing all its features can be seen <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPVMVjkYqE">here</a>.

		    			This is a satirical top down shot-em-up game where the player has to fight their way through hoardes of aliens to make it to an evacuation site. With a team of 4 other individuals, we created this web game using the Javascript framework Phaser. My contribution was implementing the basic movement controls and scene management. I also did much of the work to program and create sound effects for the game. The full game can be viewed and played on itch.io at this <a href = "https://ninjacat74.itch.io/alien-invasion">link</a>.
