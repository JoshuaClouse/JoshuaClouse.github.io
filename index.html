	                Congradulations! You are this site's 1000th visitor! Click <a href="http://www.joshclouse.com">here</a> to claim your prize! For those of you not brave enough to click that link, it just links back here. Hi, I'm Josh. I'm a game designer and software engineer. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in Computer Science: Game Design. Currently I work at Leia Inc where I create interactive applications to showcase the capabilites of our 3D displays. I love taking on problems and enjoy the energy that comes with collaborating with other engineers. An added bonus is when I get to work with peers across disciplinaries. Although I am most at home with Unity, I openly welcome opportunities that allow me to work outside my comfort zone. Wherever there are development needs, I'm always up for the challenge. 
	                <br><br>
	                In my free time I enjoy writing and playing music. I'm currently in a band. I'd provide a link to our page, but I think we need a bit more practice before I have that kind of confidence. If you are in need of a Unity Dev or Software Developer or would just like to be serenaded feel free to contact me at <span class = "highlight">JoshMClouse@gmail.com</span>. My Linkedin and Github are also provided in the top right corner.
