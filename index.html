                    Hi, I'm Josh. I recently graduated UCSC with honors in Computer Science: Game Design. I have
                    a strong foundation in computer science as well as a passion for game design. I am a quick
                    learner, adaptable,
                    and looking for a team oriented environment to apply my skillsets. In addition to school, I
                    am currently developing a VR game with 12 other collaborators called Wacktory.
                    You can see this as well as some of my other work in my portfolio link. However, when I'm
                    not staring at my computer screen, I spend my spare time (and money) playing and composing
                    music.
                    If you are interested in having me serenade your ears, or would like me as part of your
                    team, please feel free to contact me with the email provided above.
