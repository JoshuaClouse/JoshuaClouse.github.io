                        <th><p>Wacktory is an award winning game that is a mixes VR and traditional couch co-op gameplay. I am currently working on this project with 11 other collaborators using Unity and Steam VR. I mostly handle the trucks
                            code which is the backbone to the game. The code was written to allow any arangement of level layouts, item combinations, and time limits. They determine what items each level
                            will require as well as the start and end conditions. In addition to the trucks I also composed and created all the music. You can see more on our website <a href = "http://wacktory.com/"> here</a>.

                        <th><p>With a group of 4 other collaborators, we created a bot for the game Starcraft II by Blizzard Entertainment. We converted 2 API's, commandCenter and the default SC2 API, into
                            a behaviour tree format where we could then create new action, sequencer, selector... nodes in order to produce a functioning bot. As it is now, the bot can beat the "medium bot" included
                            in the game. All code was written in C++.

                        <th><p>This is a 3D space I created using Javascript, HTML, and WebGL. A user can move around through the world as a light moves across the x axis. Z near, Z far, POV, and camera postiion
                            are all adjustable. Maps are generated by using 2 pixel maps, a height map and position map, with shading being done using the Phong shading model. Optimizaton still needs to be performed
                            however all features are functional.

                        <th><p>Phonote is an app created in Android Studio by me and 4 other collaborators. It aims to help students take notes easier by converting images to text and autogenerating citation info.
                            Users can either take a picture in the app, or use a picture from their gallery to convert into text. A book title is all that is needed to automatically generate citation info. Users can also
                            save their projects to google drive. Development on the project has stopped and the app is not available on Google Play, however a video showing all its features can be seen <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzPVMVjkYqE">here</a>.

                        <th><p>This is a satirical top down shoot-em-up game where the player has to fight their way through hordes of aliens to make it to the evacuation point. The game was created using Phaser, a Javascript
                            framwork. It was made with me along with 4 other individuals over the course of around 3 months. The full game can be played <a href = "https://ninjacat74.itch.io/alien-invasion">here</a>.
